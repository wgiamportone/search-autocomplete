# Autocomplete Exercise

## Overview

A simple Autocomplete/Typeahead component in vanilla JavaScript
(compiled with Babel 7) that lets you type in a query and shows a list of
matching results in a dropdown, just like how Google's search box works.

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm start` (runs `webpack-dev-server`)
3. Open `http://localhost:8080` on your browser.
